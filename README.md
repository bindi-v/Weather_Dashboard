# Weather_Dashboard

## Task

My challenge is to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS. Third-party APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. Here I have to retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of Weather Dashboard.

## API used in Weather Dashboard

Here I use the [OpenWeather One Call API](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api) to retrieve weather data for cities.

## User Story

```md
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
```

```md
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed

WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
```
